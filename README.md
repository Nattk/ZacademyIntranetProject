#ZENIKA INTRANET 

##TECHNOLOGIES 
This website is designed with simple HTML pages, vanilla JS for components and bootstrap for styling.

##STYLING 
Every page has its own styling with the same name placed in its folder. This page is then imported into the general styles.css sheet inside the css folder at the root of the project.

##COMPONENTS
Our components are stored inside the "load_components.js" file in the "js" folder at the root of the project.

Our components are:
- Regular Navigation bar
- Admin Navigation bar
- Footer
